        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming <br>
        language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,<br>
        alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript<br> 
        on the client side for webpage behavior[10], often incorporating third-party<br>
        libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the<br> 
        code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled<br> 
        language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing<br>, 
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,<br>
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application<br>
        programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard<br>
        data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
