    <p> tCascading Style Sheets <u>(CSS)</u> is a style sheet language used for<br>
        describing the <strong>of a document written</strong>in a markup<br>
        language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,<br> 
        MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web<br>, 
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]<br>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation<br>
        <img src="css.avif" width="100%">
        of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]<br> 
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more<br> 
        flexibility and control in the specification of presentation<br> 
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by<br> 
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces<br> 
        complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the<br> 
        .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the<br>
        pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the<br>
        same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods,<br> 
        such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or<br> 
        screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for<br> 
        alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]<br>
